Hii there, I am using Xschem open source platform for creating majority of this projects. In any other case i will make a note.

To intsall Xschem i recommend to watch this video.

In case if you don't have any previous exposture to VLSI, please continue reading only after watching the above video.

TO USE XSCHEM WITH SKY WATER 130 PDK,

use this cmd inside the folder where you creat you project. `cp /usr/local/share/pdk/sky130B/libs.tech/xschem/xschemrc .`

In the above cmd we used sky130B directory instead of sky130A, So why use sky130B not sky130A,

The difference is in the metal layer, sky130B support ReRAM / RRAM.

Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) transistors offer several advantages over traditional memory technologies. Here are some key benefits:

Scalability: RRAM can scale below 10 nm, making it suitable for future technology nodes.
High Speed: RRAM operates at nanosecond speeds, which is significantly faster than many traditional memory types.
Low Power Consumption: It consumes less power, making it ideal for energy-efficient applications.
Non-Volatility: RRAM retains data even when the power is turned off, unlike traditional volatile memory like DRAM.
High Data Retention and Endurance: It offers long data retention and can endure many write/erase cycles.
Simple Structure: The metal-insulator-metal (MIM) structure of RRAM is simpler and easier to fabricate.
Compatibility with CMOS Technology: RRAM is compatible with existing CMOS technology, facilitating its integration into current semiconductor processes.
